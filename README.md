# ZZZ's computer configration.
## TERMINAL
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) on MacOS.  
I use [Microsoft Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701) on Windows.  

Remember set a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) as your terminal's font.
## SHELL
I'm using `zsh`, because of `oh-my-zsh`.  
Follow my [README](https://github.com/ZhizhenZhou/dot-config/blob/main/zsh/README.md) to install and config `zsh`.
## EDITOR
I'm switching form `vscode` to `neovim`.  
Here's my neovim config [README](https://github.com/ZhizhenZhou/dot-config/blob/main/neovim/README.md).
## ENVIRONMENT
### c and cpp
`gcc`/`g++` of course.
### python
I'm using `miniconda` to manage my python environment.  
I like to use package manager to download `miniconda`, or you can follow the [offical install guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/).
### javascript
I don't really use javascript a lot. But I need some packages on npm.  
So, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) please.
